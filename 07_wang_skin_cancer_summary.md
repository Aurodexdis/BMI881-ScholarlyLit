## *Assessment of Deep Learning Using Nonimaging Information and Sequential Medical Records to Develop a Prediction Model for Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer* $-$ Wang et al.

### Summary:
In order to accurately predict the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) using electronic medical records (EMRs) without depending on conventional risk variables, such as sun exposure or family history, this study constructed a deep learning model. The researchers examined three years' worth of sequential diagnostic and pharmaceutical data from Taiwanese national health insurance records using convolutional neural networks (CNN). With an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.894, the model demonstrated its strong performance and promise for high-risk individual identification. The study also found several predicted variables that may be used to improve NMSC prevention tactics, such as the history of precancerous lesions and the usage of specific drugs.

### Reaction:
My current research on early-stage diagnosis of Ovarian Cancer closely aligns with the application of deep learning on EMR data from NMSC prediction. Both my research and this study aim to improve patient outcomes by utilizing machine learning techniques to identify cancer risk prior to clinical diagnosis. My work focuses on the use of tree-based machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Models, and LGBM), all of which are evaluated using AUC/ROC. This is comparable to the AUROC metric seen in the NMSC study, although the NMSC study uses a CNN technique. The NMSC model's incredible accuracy in the absence of conventional risk indicators is quite interesting since it supports my objective of early-stage ovarian cancer detection through subtle, frequently disregarded symptoms. But, given my use of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for feature importance analysis, I'm interested to know how the study's CNN technique stacks up against my ensemble methods in terms of interpretability. For my work with high-dimensional data (~45,000 features), the NMSC study's success in leveraging a large feature set (over 1,500 ICD-9-CM codes and medication categories) is nice to see. Lastly, the study's identification of several drugs as predictive factors highlights the significance of my research project's methodology in analyzing a variety of data subsets, including socioeconomic, genetic, and diagnostic data, in order to fully capture an ovarian cancer risk profile.

### Discussion Questions:
1. How might the performance and applicability of this prediction model differ when applied to populations with different ethnic backgrounds or healthcare systems?
2. What ethical issues, in particular those pertaining to patient privacy and potential bias in healthcare decision-making, should be taken into account when putting such a prediction model into clinical practice?
3. How well might the model predict the risk of NMSC in younger people with incomplete medical data, considering its dependence on medication and diagnostic history? What other strategies might be looked into for this particular group?
