## *Letâ€™s Practice What We Preach: Turning Tables into Graphs* $-$ Gelman et al.

### Summary:
This article makes the case that statisticians need to follow their own advice and use graphs instead of tables to report numerical results within their research papers. The authors of this paper demonstrate how data could be presented better as graphs by analyzing tables from an issue of the Journal of the American Statistical Association (JASA) from 2000. They give numerous illustrations demonstrating the conversion of tables into graphical displays while emphasizing methods such as incorporating reference lines, using separate plots for different parameters, and aligning comparisons of interest. Additionally, the authors stress that creating a graph may take more time initially when compared to the creation of tables; however, they allow for easier and more meaningful comparisons. The authors conclude that graphs are a great alternative to tables and should be used for the majority of numerical displays in statistical research.

### Reaction:
I generally prefer graphs over tables anyway, even before reading this article; however, I still found this article to be both interesting and helpful. With many specific examples throughout the paper to support their claims, the authors presented a compelling case for the advantages of utilizing graphs over tables in a variety of situations. I appreciated that they were able to take fairly complicated, multi-dimensional data from tables and transform it into an easily interpretable graph, often using far less space than the original table. Their emphasis on identifying comparisons that are important/relevant to the research question, and creating graphics to properly demonstrate these comparisons, goes beyond just displaying the data itself and communicates the insights from the data. Although I believe that the authors' arguments are strong and persuasive, and seeing the current state of the field 20+ years after this paper was written, it can be very difficult to change the deeply rooted practices of data presentation in academic writing.

### Discussion Questions:
1. In this paper, the authors' main argument is that graphs are superior to tables for making comparisons. However, are there specific instances where tables are still superior to graphs for presenting statistical results?
2. Given the advancements in data visualization tools and software since 2002, when this paper was written, how might the authors' recommendations be updated or expanded for current-day statistical writing? Based on your own experiences, what are some new types of visualizations/interactive elements that could enhance the presentation of statistical results today?
3. We currently live in an era with big data and complex statistical models, how can we balance the need for detailed information (often presented in tables) with the clarity and interpretability offered by graphs? What are some new hybrid approaches that can combine the strengths of both tables and graphs?
