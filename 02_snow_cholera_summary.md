## *Mode of Communication of Cholera* $-$ John Snow M.D.

### Summary:
In this influential study, Dr. John Snow challanges the widely accepted, at the time, miasma theory of disease by providing very compelling evidence that cholera is spread through contaminated water. After methodically reviewing numerous cholera outbreaks in London, particularly the 1854 Broad Street Pump incident, Snow establishes a direct connection between a contaminated water source and cholera cases. Snow's thorough investigation, which included both mapping of cases and examining trends in water supply, offers compelling evidence which strongly backs his hypothesis that cholera is transmitted through the ingestion of water from sources containing a specific contaminant from the evacuation of cholera patients. Additionally, Snow explains how cholera rates in various London neighborhoods were influenced by unique business practices and different water sources.

### Reaction:
I found that Snow's well organized approach and meticulous attention to detial were quite impressive for the time that this book was written. He pioneered the use of epidemiological techniques such as statistical analysis and case mapping. I found it fascinating how he tracked down specific cholera cases down to the source of the outbreak, as seen in the Broad Street Pump incident I mentioned in my summary. Snow's reserach serves as an excellent example of how incorporating rigor and reasoned analysis into your observations can advance medical knowledge. However, one thing I was suprised by was the opposition that Snow encountered from the medical community, indicating the difficulty in challanging conventional beliefs, even when confronted with compelling evidence. In addition to advancing our knowledge of cholera, Snow's work established a solid foundation for modern epidemiology and public health practices.

### Discussion Questions:
1. At the time of publication of Snow's book, what distinguishes Snow's methods from traditional medical practices, and what made his evidence so strong?
2. What could have been the cause(s) of some of the skepticism Snow encountered, even in spite of his strong evidence?
3. If Snow had access to current day microscopy and microbiology methods, how might his discoveries have been received differently?
