## *The central role of the propensity score in observational studies for causal effects* $-$ Paul Rosenbaum & Donald Rubin

### Summary:
The propensity score is presented in this study as a powerful analytical tool for estimating causal effects from observational studies. The authors define the propensity score as the conditional probability of assignment to a specific treatment given observable covariates. The authors show that the propensity score is the same as a balancing score, which means that for treated and untreated units with the same propensity score, the distribution of the observed covariates will be the same. Three primary applications are presented in this paper: covariance correction, subclassification, and matched sampling on the propensity score. The authors demonstrate how these techniques can successfully lessen bias in treatment effect estimation when treatment assignment is strongly ignorable with mathematical evidence and examples.

### Reaction:
This paper's theoretical foundation struck me as incredibly robust, with straightforward proofs defining the characteristics of propensity scores. The idea of combining several factors into one score is clever and has the potential to be extremely useful in streamlining intricate analyses. The subclassification section piqued my interest, especially as it showed how propensity scores might be utilized to form comparable groups even in the presence of numerous covariates. Specifically, the example that used real data from a study on coronary artery disease demonstrated how subclassification on the propensity score significantly improved balance across 74 covariates. However, I wonder about the real-world difficulty and practicality of accurately defining the propensity score model. Particularly, I wonder how it is defined concerning high-dimensional data or in domains where the mechanisms of treatment assignment are poorly understood. A side note: having a bachelor's in mathematics made this paper more enjoyable, I enjoy learning about the theory behind concepts, so this was a good read in my opinion.

### Discussion Questions:
1. For most results in the research, "strongly ignorable treatment assignment" is assumed. How can researchers determine whether this assumption is reasonable in real-world observational studies, and what are the ramifications if it is not met?
2. Propensity score approaches are presented by the authors as an alternative to conventional covariate adjustment. When may traditional approaches be more appropriate, and under what circumstances might propensity score methods be preferable?
3. Written in 1983, the study predates the era of machine learning and big data. How could the use of propensity score approaches in observational research be improved or changed by contemporary computational techniques?
